#I recently learned how to code with if, elif, else

a=int(input("Enter the value of a:"))
b=int(input("Enter the value of b:"))
c=int(input("Enter the value of c:"))
if (a==b and a==c and b==c):
  print (3) # all are same
elif (a==b and a!=c and b!=c) or (b==c and b!=a and c!=a)or (c==a and c!=b and a!=b):
  print (2) # two of the numbers are same
else:
  print (0) # all are different values
